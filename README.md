# PasswordGenerator
A password generator that generates passwords automatically.

It uses synonyms from a thesaurus to generate a password similar to it.

Like SolidSnake will get HardCobra or something.

It also randomly replaces certain characters to special characters for extra security.

50% chance to change characters. This increases security, rather than having simple alphanumeric characters as your password.

Currently Microsoft considers the following for a strong password:


* At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.
* A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.

Letters with a chance to change:

a/B to @

b/B to 8

s/S to $ or 5

l/L to 1 or 7

g/g to 9

o/o to 0

-_+ may be randomly added between two words.

?!$#% may be added randomly at the end.
